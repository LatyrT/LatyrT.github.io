In this assignment, we are using machine learning to predict the weather forecasts for New York City. 

## Data Source(s)
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/


## Methods
We used 2 separate models: ARIMA (Auto Regressive Moving Average) & LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). The same dataset was split in this manner:
*  80% Train data,
*  20% Test data.

A Python notebook contains the totality of our procedure.


A tableau workbook was created to creating our reports and our final presentation and analysis.
